-- query #1: Display the cities that makes the most different kinds of products.

-- query #6: Write a query to check the accuracy of the totalUSD column in the Orders table. This means calculating Orders.totalUSD from data in other tables and comparing those values to the values in Orders.totalUSD. Display all rows in Orders where Orders.totalUSD is incorrect, if any. If there are any incorrect values, explain why they are wrong.

			 	from customers)

			 	from agents);
				

-- query #8: Create a VIEW of all Customer and People data called PeopleCustomers. Then another VIEW of all Agent and People data called PeopleAgents. Then "select *" from each of them in turn to test.

-- query #9: Display the first and last name of all customers who are also agents, this time using the views you created.
select pc.firstname, pc.lastname
from peoplecustomers pc inner join peopleagents pa on pc.pid = pa.pid
where pc.paymentterms is not null
and pa.paymentterms is not null;


-- query #10: Compare your SQL in #7 (no views) and #9 (using views). The output is the same. How does that work? What is the database server doing internally when it processes the #9 query?
-- Since a view is just a virtual table but only exists as a query instead of a memory like a base table, query #9 is just internally using the previously made views from the system catalog. A view is just representing a subset of data in a created table.
-- Views are just relations that are defined by computation and relational algebra. Although these relations are not stored, they are constructed when needed through queries.

--query #11: [Bonus] Whatâ€™s the difference between a LEFT OUTER JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN? Give example queries in SQL to demonstrate. (Feel free to use the CAP database to make your points here.)
-- In a right outer join (ex R right outer join S) it is like an outer join but the dangling tuples to the right of the join (s) are padded with null and added to the result.
-- In a left outer join (ex R left outer join S) it is also like an outer join but the dangling tuples to the left of the join (r) are padded with null and added to the result.
